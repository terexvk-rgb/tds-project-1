    "text": "Have you ever noticed — no theory truly begins from nothing. Every doctrine, every explanation, starts with an axiom : a foundational assumption, an article of belief we accept without proof. It lies outside logic, beyond questioning, not because it’s irrefutable — but because we choose to treat it as the ground from which all else can grow. We are taught to “believe” these axioms — not to prove them, but to trust them. Upon these initial leaps of faith, logic constructs vast architectures. One layer supports the next, and those “superstructures” give rise to even more complex frameworks — “super-superstructures,” if you will — until eventually, we declare: We understand. But what is this process, really? Is learning just the act of finding the missing links between ideas we’ve already agreed to believe in? Is it the acceptance of new connections as long as they don’t threaten the foundations we’ve inherited? And so the question deepens: Do we ever truly learn anything new? Or are we simply wandering the corridors of an already-built palace, discovering rooms we hadn’t noticed before — rooms built atop assumptions we never laid ourselves? Is there anything new to learn — or only new ways to believe?",

    "text": "So , the thing is , I have an issue in my life and am looking for its solution , tried everywhere so I  just though leme try here too ,maybe it would be worth putting. This post is going to be quite off topic as its category and will be very long so read only if u like reading and have some spare time , had been procrastinating to write but don’t have any other option left ( also do leme know if it infringes any policies will delete asap) . So as my roll no hints that I m from may 2023 batch , but I m still in my foundation lvl , probably the worst phase of my life . The thing is I am  a PMO addict since I was just a kid (indirect to direct) due to bad company and inner curiosity . Leme cover BG:  Raised up in a middle class family in Mumbai  Slums and both of my parents work so I used to stay alone at home and TV,phone,PC aggravated my condition . i realized there itself but was quite young to make any judgement and kept on doing as it was giving me joy , and my inquisitiveness was growing day by day making it more natural to me . I tried to stop in between but was quite undetermined though the frequency was lesser that time , time passed by and so its data in my mind which used to give me flashbacks everytime I tried to give up it , then came my  10 boards , as was easy so I somehow scored 90% , my parents were happy( me too but I felt could have done better) and with this thought we decided to give a try to JEE ,  I had thought will study seriously  but due to corona(2020-21)  had to come to village so my foundations were quite weak , gave boards but managed only 66% ,(gave improvement , didn’t work as went to kota , travelling and more)  I barely passed maths  ( the addiction was one of major reasons) I still thought of giving one more try so my parents sent me to kota by taking loan , I was quite pressurized cuz even in such a situation I was not able to quit my addiction ( loneliness , other studs enoying , homesickness , OVERTHINKING , laziness etc) .  I attended all the lectures and did studied hard but drop year is something very tough if u didn’t study much in 11-12th  , I mastered chemistry and physics too to some extent , but couldn’t do maths , though scored fine in mains but failed in adv .  But then news came that 75% is back so my NIT dreams too got thrashed , I thought everything ended for me except a pvt clg on another loan but then I got to know about this degree ( very thankful to IITM) took admission before adv . I am in a village in Up now ( little issues like family stuffs and light though excuses) . Now I decided to focus completely on this degree but ( my strong parts chem and phy are of no use to me know ) and I struggled with maths and stats even programming as its new to me . It’s my 6th term of foundation now, the last hope . leme breakdown: 1st T : all 4 subs jee based   couldn’t study  adv and travelling             2n T : became campus ambassador , but passed with 6 cgpa ,   3rdT : stats2 , maths 2 , Python , couldn’t study well due to addiction , ,illness  and OPPE so thought  lets do all 3 to improve CGPA 4th Term : all 3 again OPPE halted me ,  5th Term : all 3 + CT impr( improved only 1 grade) , 6th current Term : all 3 + stats 1 impr  ,   whatever I have done in my life this addiction has always been a part of it ( though other factors too but this was the major one) I read tons of articles , saw 100s of recovery videos , read books like easy peasy method , used blockers and extensions , started exercise and meditation  but being from tech always found a way to escape through  ,  I do it every 2nd or 3 day on avg ( sometimes more than once) now I feel like I was wasted my life so far cuz I am 20 now , became twice junior to my batchmates ,  can’t see any way ,    being in a community with so many people who are somewhat successful and at least doing something better , I beg u all to plz suggest me something , rebuke me , abuse me , do whatever but I literally wanna get out of this trap and wanna do something better in my life , I don’t use social media nor any other thing like cricket but this thing … I am quite ashamed to write  … but I feel maybe someone’s experience might help me  esp of experienced people like Anand sir , Karthik sir . If u read till here then I thank u with all my heart and wish u more success in life ! Thanks again .",

You might have tried to improve your situations by your actions but they might have fallen short. You might not have been able to achieve what you set out to achieve. It happens. It happens to everyone bro. It happened even to me! But don’t worry. Let’s start with small steps. Don’t set goals like I want to pass maths 2 or stats 2. It’s a bit a vague, but rather tell yourself that you’re going to learn the concepts of Maths 2 and Stats 2. Try other programming resources like w3schools or freecodecamp.org or even apna college youtube channel. They teach you very well. I’m open to help you bro! Because I understand that you want to grow and prove yourself, not to anyone, but you. I get that you’re feeling low in your life now, but this too shall pass. I recommend listening to few self help episodes  ‘Daily Wisdom’. They kind of help you. Even I’m starting out my offline college, so i understand the 11th and 12th phase. I know that I’ve never met you. I don’t know whether this helps you, just know that there are people who are facing the same phase of life with you right now. We just don’t share it out loud. It doesn’t mean that we’re not hurting. Start some physical activities like walking, jogging or even running and exercise. They’ll help you keep positive thoughts about yourself. I can’t guarantee that feeling positive about yourself will help you make your situations better, but I can guarantee you that feeling worst about yourself WILL MAKE  your situations even worse. You will having a thriving life in future, just persevere this hard phase. LIFE IS GOOD BRO, give it some time. HAVE A GREAT DAY ahead !!!",

Life will keep on pushing you but you have to face it head on. A few pointers I can give you for your addiction: Minimize your time on social media Never stay alone Keep yourself distracted, help with house chores, study etc. And it may sound rude but let me tell you we all can only give you advice, but you are the person who has to put themselves into action, nothing is going to change, if you don’t do anything. We all are here to help, but only if you take the first step. Edit: Also I’d like to add that if you ever want to talk or vent something, I am willing to listen to you, no matter what, and not only me a lot of people in this community will most definitely be willing to help.",

    "text": "Hey there!! I’m Anupam. You know, we all have hard phases in life, but the thing is that how we tackle from those problems. You might have tried to improve your situations by your action but now you have to put some more efforts. Firstly, do Meditation with Positive thoughts like \" I am a Pure Soul, I am intelligent Soul, I am able to complete my syllabus, I am able to score 9+ CGPA, I am able to become , I am able to Overcome from PMO addiction\" in your mother tongue. Second, start your Course within present like when you are study math’s at that time only study and don’t think about that you have to pass or math is tough for me or my basic is weak, don’t think about this and that time only focus on the content and by meditation you’ll achieve the focus slowly. Third, try to make new account on social media and in settings enable strict mode so, you don’t see any irrelevant content and try not to be alone and make yourself busy because if you free then your thoughts go in that side so, try to make yourself busy. Fourth, try to sleep early and wake early morning 4:00 AM or 5:00 AM and don Meditation and then after Study. Fifth, in morning go for Walk or jogging (not running because by doing running, you’ll tired), by which you feel fresher. Sixth, try to go worship place (according to your faith) at least in a month once and if possible then every week would be more helpful. Seventh, try to be Positive in every situation because in failure also you got some experience while will help to make better decision in future for your Success & Remember that Failure is the Part of Success. I don’t know your and never met you but I’m sure that these points will definitely help you to tackle with your situation. I’m here if you need help. Remember, You have good life and your future is bright, just do your best in this hard phase. Have a Great day Be Positive",

    "text": "@23f2001123 As with any addiction, there are varying degrees. Some people find success in overcoming it by themselves with a drastic change of routine and such. But in particular cases, when one genuinely feels like nothing they have tried is working, professional intervention might be needed. While the collective wisdom of a forum like this is sufficiently motivating, you might have to seek medical help. Subject to financial constraints, talk to a psychiatrist. Of course, listen to what others have to say here, but seeking professional help just might be the best option for you as they are likely to be far more experienced and qualified to help you than folk who are themselves relatively “doing well”.",

    "text": "Is this the real problem? The addiction you are taking about is surely a issue , but it cannot be a issue so overwhelming as you said. How can addiction make you poor in mathematics but good in physics n chemistry?! I would personally not like to correlate your addiction to your performance in IIT M. But I guess there are other factors involved , maybe your lonely, depressed , abuse for some reasons and that’s is where the problem lies. Or maybe you simply don’t like these subjects , this is not ur forte. Whatever is the reason you have to figure it out.Even maybe the things are tough for u , and your brain is not liking to work harder. Though the addiction affects and harm you education, but years after years it spiralling you down seems little exaggerated. It may not be porn specifically but what triggers it , why the trigger is question! Find out the reasons which actually doesn’t allow you to focus when u are studying, what happens when you start studying, what difficulty do you face during studying etc etc? List them, work on them…this platform I would say you would have to best kind of support… People go out of the way to help each other to study Coming to the addiction part. It is like a chain , it has a trigger, action and reaction. These goes on… Here is an example of how it works… Maybe your in your room alone the privacy is the trigger, your brain wants to be happy always , it needs dopamine for it. The brain knows watching porn (lets address it as it should be) will make it happy , it can release the dopamine. So u make the action. Reaction - dopamine release you are happy. The cycle is on. Oh! Remember the dopamine release gets saturated, I mean the body then feels no excitement with the release of a certain amount of it as it is adjusted. So option , release more of it. How? You are more addicted , more things trigger you to watch porn ! So check the trigger points , and try to avoid them. Those cannot be avoid , try  changing the action to the trigger. Do something else , go for a walk , pinch yourself lightly, read a chapter from a good book , write a poetry etc etc. PS: I am not health care professional or related to psychology or its allies fields. Please take the advice as a peer advice and act accordingly. I could strongly recommend you to consult psychiatrist if possible. Public institutions provide for free it finance is a constraint. Try e Sanjeevani of government for free tele medicine consult.",

    "text": "Hey there, My name’s Adnan and I completely empathize with your situation. Reading your post, I can see that quite a lot has happened for you and feeling depressed is pretty natural given the circumstances. You’re just 20-21, to be honest - life isn’t ending and you’re just a decision away from an entirely different life. While it can be difficult to combat any form of addiction, especially one you mentioned - Let me tell you it’s not impossible. There are tonnes of practical advice that can be given for quitting addiction, but let me just begin by saying; that ‘its entirely alright, what you’re feeling is natural and with time, it will pass, you will evolve and be a much different person’ Having addressed your need for reassurance, here’s some practical advice Reevaluate your life on a serious note - it’s okay to feel lost, what’s not okay is to give up sight of ‘what’ you want to achieve in the long run. When you’re driven by a solid goal, it’ll become your guiding post, your north star - every time you’re feeling lost, reevaluate with your goals and begin again. Start reading books on how habits are built. All habits - good and bad, are only a set of behaviors that are triggered due to certain cues and indulging in the habit gives you a ‘reward’. You’re a brilliant student, see habits in a scientific manner and you’ll also find a way to alter/break or create new ones. I’ll recommend two good books on habits The Power of Habits - Charles Duhigg Atomic Habits - James Clear Start by reading these, you’ll come out much smarter on how to improve your life Lastly, as cliche as it sounds, life is not a rat race. You have your journey to walk and other have theirs. The grass on the other side always looks greener but the truth is, everyone has their own set of challenges in life. Also don’t forget the massive effort and hard work your parents have put behind you - just to see you succeed in life, and achieve things that were too far-fetched for them. If anything, you have to succeed for them, break the generational curse. Keep your head up, you can do it Here are two cents of advice from someone much older than you. If you feel the need to talk or would like to discuss some practical ways to improve - feel free to drop a message",

DeepSeek is backed by a significant sized quantitative hedge fund (High-Flyer Capital Management) and not just some small easier effort. Adding onto the previous point somes compute power. High-Flyer Capital Management had invested in about ~$139M super computer cluster in 2021. Although the number of AI specialized professionals are growing in India its still a smaller fraction compared in the entire IT industry. Dont forget that R1 isn’t the first model which was released by DeepSeek. They have a sustainable overtime development and previous costs aswell. So key takeaway points being: Lack of access to computing infrastructure. Availability of high-quality, datasets. Sustained R&D efforts over time",

    "text": "Part 1 Creating a model similar to R1 or o1/o3 is worthwhile, but building a foundational model that delivers true economic value requires more than just money (I’ll return to the money aspect later). It fundamentally requires people—researchers, developers, and engineers in general. (To clarify, I am not driven by patriotism but rather by the pursuit of a peaceful life.) I was particularly frustrated when Sam Altman remarked, on Indian soil, “It’s hopeless to compete with us in foundational models.” I found it disheartening that while he runs a nonprofit and drives a Lamborghini using investor funds—claiming to build AI for humanity—his models remain closed-source and come with pricey premium plans (for example, the recent o3 or 4.5 models require a fee, with a cost equivalent to $200 or roughly 17,500 INR) let’s take benefit of the doubt and say they need money to train new models so they are charging us but then thier research paper for o3/ 4.5 are also not public so it’s not really benefiting the humanity but rather profiting by selling a product and buying Lambo out of it. In contrast, two trillion-dollar companies are run by CEOs of Indian descent, and one of them, Microsoft, has heavily funded OpenAI with billions of dollars. Yet, both leaders ultimately left because they prioritized a peaceful life over nationalist sentiment. To address brain drain, our focus should shift toward providing a high quality of life rather than merely reducing taxes. TL;DR Part 1: We need two things—capital and people. People: China has been preparing for AI since the early 2000s. Many engineers, not just software developers, were already being trained in AI. R1’s success partly comes from solving the problem of training models under sanctions (though we currently do not face such sanctions). Capital: Regarding capital, we possess substantial computing power. Consider the case of DeepSeek R1. Even if there were claims of exaggerating their computing capacity, other researchers would have detected such discrepancies while attempting to replicate their work. Instead, many were able to create a scaled-down clone of R1 for just $4,500 (see deepscaler ). Why We Should Not Focus Solely on Building a Foundational Model: Rather than trying to clone models like R1, o1, o3, Claude 3.7, Grok3, or others, we should adopt a different mindset. Yes, I am aware that China has engaged in controversial practices such as illegally importing banned GPUs (I won’t delve deeply into that as I value my life). Even under sanctions, they managed to build something that surprised the entire AI industry. The U.S. may be trying to prevent other countries from challenging its dominance, but according to R1’s research paper, its founders essentially “coded the GPU in the machine language equivalent” because they were barred from using NVIDIA’s CUDA library. This innovative, first-principles approach allowed them to optimize so effectively that they managed to train their model with only $6 million. You know what’s preventing us , nothing! People have started building in India ( one of them is Sarvam ) but the fact their models can’t even compete with the leading non-reasoning models, so in a way they are useless they don’t really provide any economic value (yet, this experience will grow us soon to compete with tech giants) Conclusion: Instead of focusing on cloning or developing similar models, we should aim to think innovatively and build something significantly better than what we currently have (not only cheaper but smarter). The goal is not merely to replicate existing models but to create a model where, for example, a 70-billion-parameter model could compete with a 500-billion-parameter one—much like Microsoft’s Phi4 compared to GPT-4o or MiniCPM-o (8b) vs GPT4o.",

    "text": "Hii @Ashwin_J Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to follow up regarding the feedback I received on my proposal report. I submitted my proposal on March 3, 2025, and was informed on March 4, 2025, by the BDM team that it was on HOLD due to TA comments about the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt chart . I revised my report accordingly and resubmitted it on March 7, 2025. Today, however, I received new comment from the TA stating that “Status: Plagiarised. Remarks: Upon reviewing your proposal report, I noticed similarities with other reports.” I’m confused as to why this issue was not raised during the revision period, especially since I made significant changes based on the initial feedback. This puts me in a difficult position as I now have to wait until the next term to submit my proposal, with no submission window in April 2025. Could you please clarify the situation and provide further guidance on how to proceed? I would appreciate your help in resolving this issue as soon as possible. I am a Direct Entry to Diploma (DAD) student, and this is my final term in the course. Regards, Harsh Vardhan Kumar 24DS2000078",

    "text": "I remember the first time I stumbled across my existential crisis. It was in my second year of college. It hit me really hard, and I was left with crippling depression for almost two years. During that time, I messed up my academics and lacked the motivation to do pretty much anything. So believe me when I say: I know where you come from. I know the pain you feel. But now, I’m in a much, much better place. Let me explain what that place is and how I got here. This is not a propaganda of any sort. I don’t claim to have answers about anything. These are just musings and wonderings from someone who doesn’t have anything figured out. I just think we need to have more questions in our mind before we think we have answers to even a few. What I’m saying is that conclusions about the world should have a question mark or a comma, instead of a full stop. Now, unlike before, I am willing to accept that a higher power and design in the world is also a possibility. I know what you might be thinking: Just another idiot with baseless hope. (I used to feel the same about anyone who had such ideas when I was struggling with my existential angst in college.) What I think is that any conclusion derived by anybody on the nature of existence is premature. When I was in college, I observed that the foundation of religion was weak and, at times, illogical. I therefore concluded that they were wrong about higher power and design. What I later realized was that I was wrong to stop there and think I had all the answers. So where do we even begin? I think what we lack is an understanding of the extent of complexity of the world we are in. We don’t have the means—or even the mental faculty—to measure the immensity of what is right in front of us. There are so many factors that had to weave together perfectly to realize the laws of nature, which in turn led to the evolution of human, animal, and plant species. We have taken “familiarity” with the world, built after so many interactions, to mean some form of “knowledge” about it. But we were—and still are—children brought into this world with no clue about what is happening. When we logically analyze the world, the right approach should be to start thinking from fundamentals and a zero-knowledge slate. But I don’t think the slate is entirely zero. Look at the laws of the world: light with its colors, matter (just look at the sand we stand on—what even is it?), gravity, sound, the laws of motion, inertia, water, metals, electricity, and so on. Are these just normal things? What if tomorrow we saw a flying, rainbow-colored, singing elephant with horns? Would you say that’s a more surprising and unrealistic occurrence compared to the phenomena and laws of the world I mentioned earlier? Gravity, or any of these natural laws, is way more exotic, unique, and improbable than the flying elephant—by a supreme magnitude of difference. You may call me a romantic, but I believe the existence of these phenomena should contribute to something in our search for answers. So that’s about the things that existed before the evolution of species. What we are currently “logically” assuming is that life simply evolved in this world perfectly—without the help of any external agents or intelligence. Stacks got stacked, screws got fitted, and pieces of the puzzle simply guided themselves into place. But think about it: how vast is the number of neurochemicals and structures that got created by themselves without guidance? We, who jokingly call upon alien intervention in building pyramids or Stonehenge, might be too quick to overlook the possibility of agents behind evolution itself. I’m not questioning this without an alternative in mind. Please check this post: Does God Play Dice? This post explores the possibility that quantum waves, if manipulated, could lead to the control of matter and chemical reactions. Basically, quantum mechanics might enable  capable powers to meddle with evolution. I’ll stop rambling like a fanatic because, if the point I’m trying to make isn’t coming through, talking more won’t help. The point is this: The world is massive, and we, with our small brains, cannot conclude anything yet. When we claim that everything is here by coincidence, we should keep in mind the immensity of that claim—and how many, many factors contributed to that coincidence. It could actually be a magnificent coincidence. But until we have all the answers, every  possibility should remain alive, scientifically explored, and thoughtfully considered. All we have are “opinions” and not truth (including mine). Like I said, I believe it should be a question mark, not a full stop.",

    "text": "I hope my reply helped you in some way.  I believe that we can’t say anything about the true nature of reality. Our ideas of the world and how things should be have completely evolved from our experience and exposure to this world and hence limited by that. Why should this world or anything be possible, we don’t know. Truth is we have no data or information as to what the absolute nature of actual reality is or what is possible. Just like a frog in a well not having any information or idea about the outside world. Also here are some ideas I focus on when having existential questions(None of these are absolute or accurate…just ponderings…so take them in with  a  pinch of salt) The age of universe is 13.7 billion years  and age of  human life is approximately 100 years old. So the probability that you exist at  point in time is 100/13.7 billion …which is equal to 1/ hundred million. That level of probability is close metaphorically to odds of finding something you lost in a vast sea at the first place you looked for it(you just looked for it and found  it!). So the case I’m making is that there is more probability that we always existed(as consciousness or whatever) (was searching in the ocean for a long time)   than we just happened to be alive at this point in time. Physical and mathematical laws of nature are intelligence itself(could be thought opposite way that intelligence was derived from nature laws , again just ideas, not accurate). Nature itself is showing  incomprehensibly high level of intelligence in multiple domains. Hence could be  a design. Like I said , these are just ideas that are for the sake of personal exploration. I’m not claiming that they are accurate or correct.",

I am personally quite re-assured that there is no sentience in AI though I understand some are alarmed when it seems, appears as such. Is there a possibility of sentience development in AI in the next 20 - 50 years? Observably sentient, i.e. appearing sentient to external observation, sure. “If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck” — Something engineered or pulled together which talks as intelligently as, say, Jarvis in Iron Man. Provably sentient is but still different. ML models are input-to-output mappings, so it’s proving ‘sentience’ in the mathematical model doing the input to output, inside under the hood. Both the definition of ‘sentience’ in such a setup and the methods of proof for showing are either currently undefined, or not yet known to me. Though we can otherwise easily tell apart between sentience and non-sentience (e.g. dogs vs logs) but a content definition of sentience, which is the one which has to do with the provable part, is not easily had. en.m.wikipedia.org Mind–body problem The mind–body problem is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and body. It addresses the nature of consciousness, mental states, and their relation to the physical brain and nervous system. The problem centers on understanding how immaterial thoughts and feelings can interact with the material world, or whether they are ultimately physical phenomena.\n This problem has been a central issue in philosophy of mind since the 17th centu... Whether it’s art, design or language, AI can only move in the grooves available for it in the data. It cannot see beyond it, it’s in that box. So looking outside the box — genuine creativity or originality which humans will appreciate, can be found by humans only. And that originality is worth more, not less, in an age where fluff potentially AI generated becomes more common. For example, AI cannot coin neologisms – like the words ‘start-up’, and ‘Booktique’.

However, if you keep replaying the incident in your mind, you end up suffering far more than they originally intended. In this way, your own mind causes you greater harm than their actions ever could ( by thinking of revenge). The wisest response is to let go, move on, and focus on living your life.",

Before joining this degree i had completed 15 months of training at NATIONAL DEFENCE ACADEMY(Army wing) though the complete training is for 3 years, I had sustained spinal injuries so couldn’t continue further. See the thing about revenge is that its a state of mind. In our academy they taught us 10 principles of war and out of that one of my favorite is “SELECTION AND MAINTENANCE OF AIM”, The reason I mentioned it is, if anytime you come across any person who has betrayed you or has carried out some action against you, you should pause for a sec or two and do a quick deep analysis as to whether your motive of taking out revenge on that person truly resonates with your purpose, if it doesn’t then silence is the best key to all such wrong motives. Now sometimes the perspective might change and we may consider revenge as the only option to equalize the conflict but again that might lead to your loss of time and energy. So, if that enemy of yours troubles you , just channelize that negative energy expelled by that person to you in order to damage your mindset into positive energy to achieve your target. The satisfaction you get after fulfilling your purpose is much greater than the satisfaction you “might” get after taking revenge(because who knows that person might plan another revenge on you ) So, its better to keep your intentions clean, yes if there is some unlawful things done against you then fight lawfully and confidently.",

Thinking it was a threat, it snapped back and bit the saw, severely wounding its mouth. Blinded by anger from being hurt, it decided to enact revenge on the saw by suffocating it, so it wrapped around the saw and started squeezing with all its might. The poor snake kept cutting itself on the saw until it died. If only it had ignored the cut and moved on, it would have stayed alive. Moral: When we react viscerally with anger and condemn those who have wronged us, we only end up hurting ourselves. It is sometimes better to ignore some situations and people’s insults because the consequences can be irreversible and catastrophic. Forgive the people who have wronged you. Don’t give them power over you .",

And How much time do we have to complete one project? Ans3: You have to do it yourself, there are some guidance session specifically for project by Instructors and TAs and some paid online/offline bootcamps, more details when you register for a project and get along with it, don’t worry. And you have to complete project in that term according to deadlines of each stage informed by the team after you register. Q4: Recommend me the course selection for 4 terms. Ans: MLF, MAD-1, DBMS MLT, BDM, MAD-2 MLP, BA, SC PDSA, TDS, JAVA Project can be taken one per term: (MAD-1, MAD-2, BDM, MLP OR MAD-1, BDM, MAD-2, MLP) OR BDM, DBMS, MLF MLT, SC, MAD-1 MAD-2, MLP, JAVA BA, TDS, PDSA Projects as per your understanding This may not suit you, select accordingly with your modification keeping corequisites and prerequisites in mind. Q5: Should i start early? Ans: Early start is always an advantage, but starting as usual is also not bad, depends on you whether to take break and start OR start early, slow and then pick up the pace (Break is necessary) Q6: The lectures and sessions are enough? Do i need to do anything extra? From any text book? Ans: Lectures and Session were enough for me, but it may not be for everyone, everyone has their preferences, it depends on your understanding and language too. I say, do a little experimenting on how you are able to understand and proceed. And for reference to extra resources, always search on discourse, many people have given many good external resources made by them or found by them. I will be linking them in this post soon.

PLAN 1.2 BDM, DBMS, MLF MLT, SC, MAD-1 MAD-2, MLP, JAVA BA, TDS, PDSA Projects as per your understanding This may not suit you, select accordingly with your modification keeping corequisites and prerequisites in mind.",

(project payment is valid for 2 terms and BDM project takes 2 terms for many students) take TDS in the very last term. (words from the instructor, TAs and personal experience of current term) MAD2 project is lengthy so take it with easier subjects like BDM. Try not to do 2 projects in single term. I would take MAD1 and MAD1 project in 1st term since i had programming background. Co-requisites are not enforced, but suggested. Pre-requisites are enforced. So you can take DBMS, TDS, MLF accordingly Planning is up to you, I have finished all subjects except BA and MLP/BDM projects.",

A Chi-square table was included — presumably to support a relevant question — yet there was no mention of the significance level or p-value to be used in testing the null hypothesis. Were we meant to assume these values? Or was it simply an unannounced test of interpretative creativity? To add to the confusion, a goodness-of-fit question appeared elsewhere in the paper, with no indication that it was connected to the aforementioned table. If they were related, their disjointed placement suggests either an oversight or a puzzling design choice that made the logical flow of the paper difficult. If they were not related, then the inclusion of the table becomes questionable in itself. It is only fair to ask: what compensatory measures are being considered to address the undue disadvantage caused by this lack of clarity?",

    "text": "After three days of intense meditation, I returned to the material world and learned something intriguing from my daughter. She told me about a peculiar belief held at her university, NYU. According to her, no student dares to walk under the iconic Washington Square Arch. The superstition claims that doing so would prevent them from graduating within four years. This curious anecdote reminded me of a story I once heard from a friend, long ago: In a remote village in Tamil Nadu, there lived a priest with his daughter and a black cat. After becoming a widower, the priest dedicated himself to performing rituals and ceremonies for the villagers, who relied solely on him for their religious needs. Before conducting a homam (a sacred fire ritual), the priest followed a strict routine. He would ask his daughter to bathe in the backyard stream and bring water for the ritual. She also prepared other materials and was familiar with the entire process. One peculiar detail stood out: just before starting the homam, the priest would always instruct his daughter to tie the black cat to a post. Years later, the priest passed away, and during the mourning period, the black cat also died. When the villagers, finding no one else capable of performing the rituals, turned to the priest’s daughter, they believed she knew all the rites by heart. As she prepared for the homam, she suddenly insisted on having a black cat to tie to the post. Unbeknownst to her, her father’s original purpose for tying the cat was simply practical—to keep it from causing disruptions during the ceremony. This story offers a profound lesson: rituals are often born from practical purposes, yet their true meanings can fade over time, leaving only blind adherence to tradition. Reflecting on the superstition at NYU, I wondered if it could be linked to an ancient Roman custom. The Romans had a practice where, upon the completion of an arch, the engineer responsible for its construction stood beneath it as the capstone was set in place—an act symbolizing ultimate accountability for their work. Could this old tradition echo faintly in the modern superstition of avoiding the arch? Every formula we have learned in this course is rooted in a wealth of underlying concepts. Let us remember these foundational ideas and avoid applying the formulas blindly.",

As students of this course, we are united in our mission to build a better nation equipped to face the challenges of the digital world. It is said that intelligence is the ability to adapt to changing environments, and we, too, must adjust our actions when circumstances evolve. However,  the current system at IITM continues to send repeated emails urging students to join the course—even to those who have already completed all formalities, including fee payment. This raises concerns about the credibility of our institution, especially when we aim to teach advanced topics such as artificial intelligence. A fundamental principle in digital communication, particularly in marketing, is targeting the right audience. Overlooking this essential aspect undermines our efforts and sends a contradictory message about our capabilities. I kindly urge the concerned team to address this issue by implementing appropriate filters to ensure such reminders reach only those for whom they are relevant. This small yet significant improvement will not only enhance the efficiency of our communication but also reflect our commitment to the principles we teach.",

    "text": "@andrew @jkmadathil @Bharathi Professor Andrew Thangaraj’s inspiring address at the G20 summit drew me to join this Data Science program — not just for the joy of solving problems, but to truly understand the challenges our education system faces in shaping the next generation. Yesterday, while my son was helping me clear some messages on my phone, he came across a few promotional texts and asked, “Dad, if you’re learning how to make machines intelligent from data, how come you’re still getting these irrelevant messages even after a year at this institute? The juice vendor at the beach knows exactly what you like as soon as you show up — and he’s not even literate!” He made a valid point. While deep research into the mysteries of our world is essential, it’s equally important that we apply what we learn in meaningful, everyday ways — creating smarter, more thoughtful systems that reflect the intelligence we strive for. A humble suggestion: let’s make better use of simple tools to filter communications and target only relevant recipients, based on their current status. It not only helps us practice what we preach but also sets a better example of how intelligence from data can improve real-life interactions. image 956×960 168 KB",

It’s fascinating how certain truths become ‘inappropriate’ the moment they step into the wrong ears. But alas, the world must be protected from dangerous ideas. EDIT CONTINUES: Now, about these “some” people—beings of unparalleled intellect, architects of industry wisdom, custodians of what qualifies as a ‘real’ education. With their foresight, they don’t just build careers; they sculpt the very perception of them. And if your path dares to deviate from the hallowed corridors of traditional academia, well, good luck, because the whispers of “some” travel far and fast. GETTING TO THE END: The moral of the story? The game isn’t just about skill—it’s about narrative. And right now, we’re the underdogs in a tale being written by those who already sit atop the throne. But history has a way of turning pages, and when the time comes, let’s make sure we write our own chapters. LAST EDIT: If you visit the campus, you’ll find that not all doors swing open for you. But the trees? The breeze? The sky? Nature is far less judgmental. (Surely this is still allowed? ) What is “some”? —— Slightly Omniscient, Mostly Egotistical.

And I totally get it—giving this prestige to a first-year student might not sit well with many. No worries, I’m a first-year student, and I won’t “disturb” the IITM campus, as we BS students are no longer  with iitm card and we dont diserve in first year too , But what truly saddens me is seeing our own campus mates questioning our place. Yes, I understand that our intellect didn’t match theirs in JEE. But is JEE the only measure of one’s ability to contribute to humanity? If a student from our program proves themselves after the first year, earns a solid CGPA, and masters the rigor of the coursework, then isn’t he just as deserving? After all, we aren’t taking online exams from the comfort of home, nor are we being handed free marks. And in the end— don’t worry. The sheer rigor of this program filters out the weak. Those who persist will not just graduate; they will contribute to the legacy of IITM itself. Our seniors from this course have already set things in motion, igniting a fire. Students from our program are winning major hackathons, and mark my words—one day, an IITM BS student will build a unicorn startup and hire the best minds of India. Who knows? Maybe that day isn’t too far away.",

I’ve met a lot of “IITians” in my 25 year career. There’s definitely a percentage that is way up there in terms of intellect, but for the rest, they are just people with normal intelligence like the rest of the world. In fact, some of them are way dumber than most and have to cover up for it by working twice as hard as everyone else. It doesn’t take much to figure that out once in-depth discussions start on any topic. That “IIT” aura can only take you so far in life. Everyone, including the people posting in these subreddits knows that. That’s why they are shit scared of losing all credibility and jobs in the market. Think about it this way. Would you pick a civil engineer from IIT who has done a few Kaggle projects in his whole life vs. someone who has a degree in Data Science from the same institute?

Is there really no difference? IMO this is a big problem with this online vs offline debate. Detractors of the online degree are talking about the weak lower bound.

Anyone could have gone through it and determined whether the posts were made by on-campus students or not. Maybe you should have checked the comments made about the LinkedIn user who called out the BS program (sorry, I forgot his name). I have a general question that is unrelated to this post: What is the proof that luck plays a role in success? Proof? Karthik_POD: All of us who run the program are quite convinced that this is probably the best initiative of its kind in our country and is something that we need moving forward. We certainly have gaps to fill in the whole teaching-learning-placement experience in our program. But I believe we will get there. I agree with you completely from the core of my heart and mind and genuinely believe that this initiative is important. I never questioned any of that I left my offline state gov CSE seat for this degree. Why are you bringing this up? Karthik_POD: Let us not forget that the on-campus student count is somewhere between 5k to 10k in each IIT, and most of them are busy with their own courses and careers. I get the feeling that you strongly doubt whether those posts were written by on-campus students because you mentioned that they are “busy” with their courses. However, I am not interested in proving it either—how could I? Karthik_POD: If you are talking about the Reddit screenshots, it was certainly not too powerful for mortals to comprehend. It wasn’t worth any mortal’s time. It wasn’t just screenshots. You make it sound as if it were just random images from someone’s Instagram. Comprehension is highly subjective, especially when it comes to different individuals. The fact that you decided on your own that it wasn’t worth anyone’s time makes me wonder—who sets the rules on what deserves attention and what doesn’t? Why should this be generalized? Shouldn’t it be left to the readers to decide for themselves? Karthik_POD: By the way, far more dangerous posts with fiery remarks about the program, faculty, and operations have found a happy home here in Discourse. If we begin censoring all of them, this platform would become boring, to say the least. As far as I remember, none of my posts have fallen into that category (overgeneralization again). Also, if other controversial posts have not been censored, why was this one? Karthik_POD: I would say that the team is probably better informed than you think. They don’t make it a point to publicly discuss these things because that doesn’t help anyone. I never questioned that. However, since you mentioned it, I would strongly suggest that you or the course team conduct a poll regarding any matter that directly impacts studies, placements, etc. By the way, if you are still looking for proof, I think I have one. But I believe you misunderstood me. The reason I made the original post is that I know there are always some naive peers who might engage in behaviour that could negatively affect how the degree is perceived. My intention was to warn or make people aware of what not to do. Lastly, to summarise  I strongly disagree with most of your points.",

    "text": "My specific doubt is on the topic: I gave my re-OPPE exam today and faced many technical glitches like my video not being visible to the proctor and my code showing syntax errors even though it was correct. My doubt is: I faced issues in Q8 from the OPPE held on 6th April. During today’s exam (9:30 AM – 11:00 AM), I encountered multiple technical issues that severely impacted my ability to complete the paper on time. Right from the start, my video feed was not visible to the proctor, which created a lot of confusion and stress. Additionally, I faced a persistent issue where my code—particularly for Q8 —was showing syntax errors despite being correct. I did not even make any changes to the code, yet it kept showing an error. After almost 1.5 hours of struggling with it, it finally got submitted at 10:59 AM , just a minute before the exam ended. Because of all the time lost in trying to fix these issues (which were beyond my control), I could not properly attempt Q5 and Q7 . I did manage to partially solve both, but had to rush through them due to lack of time. I believe I could have completed them fully if these glitches hadn’t taken up so much of my exam time. I kindly request you to consider awarding me bonus marks for Q5 and Q7 due to these technical difficulties. The delay and errors were not caused by me, and I genuinely did my best under the circumstances. Thank you for your consideration and understanding. Mention what you have done till now to find clarification on the doubt: I ensured that my internet and system were working properly before and during the exam. I tried refreshing the interface and re-running the code multiple times to fix the syntax issue in Q8 . I informed the proctor during the exam about the video feed issue, but it wasn’t resolved. He eventually asked me to switch to my MacBook (where I was already giving the exam), which caused additional disturbance. I waited until the very last moment in the hope that the code would finally be accepted, which it was—at 10:59 AM . I am now officially raising this doubt for review and fair consideration. @PiyushW @22f3000605",

    "text": "Dear @livin @PiyushW , I would like to raise a concern regarding Question 1 in Section 2 of the Python exam (OPPE2). While attempting this question, I encountered a TypeError: ‘type’ object is not subscriptable , which caused a lot of confusion. Although my logic was correct, I couldn’t verify or debug it properly because the output wasn’t visible. The error message was misleading and didn’t help identify the actual issue. Had the output been visible, many of us could have easily fixed our code and achieved the correct result. Due to this, I ended up rewriting and commenting out parts of my code out of frustration. I genuinely believe I could have resolved the issue if the error message had been clearer or if the output had been accessible. I spent more than 30–40 minutes just on this question, trying to fix the error. Kindly check the logic in my solution, as even if the question appears cleared from your end, my code may still show an error due to the commented sections . This exam is extremely important to me. If the marks for this question are not considered, my efforts over the past months will be wasted. I sincerely request you to please review the question and consider awarding marks based on the logic. Thank you for your time and understanding. Recommended: I tried all methods, but no response received yet",

This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by @s.anand as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos you gave us. For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated. How to fix bugs in our scripts Create Pull requests to Jivraj-18/tds-jan25-project1 . Docker Image Architecture Issue Report If your Docker image was run on the wrong architecture, please fill out this form: Submit Report Bug fixes If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros. Kind regards, TDS Team",

We are looking to write the matrix A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = U\\Sigma V^T Since A is 2\\times 3 , U is a 2\\times 2 orthogonal matrix, \\Sigma is a 2\\times 3 matrix, and V is a 3\\times 3 orthogonal matrix. Work out the eigenvalues of AA^T : AA^T =  \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \n  2 & -1 \\\\ 1& 2\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}  5 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \n  5\\end{bmatrix} As it is already diagonal, the eigenvalues are the entries along the main diagonal: \\lambda_1 = 5 , \\lambda_2=5 . The singular values are \\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{5} , \\sigma_2 = \\sqrt{5} . So the structure of \\Sigma matrix is known: {\\color{blue}\n   \\Sigma = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{5} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{5} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} } Work out the unit eigenectors of AA^T . The eigenvectors are  obtained by solving for the vector x , the equation (AA^T-5 I ) x =0 . This gives \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} x = 0 which is true for every vector x . As such we can choose any two unit vectors. Let’s choose the standard basis for \\mathbb{R}^2 : u_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad u_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \n  \\end{bmatrix} so that the matrix {\\color{blue}\n   U =  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} } To get the right singular vectors: v_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} A^Tu_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{bmatrix} \n  2 & -1 \\\\ 1& 2\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{bmatrix} \n  2  \\\\  1\\\\  0 \\end{bmatrix} And v_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} A^Tu_2 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{bmatrix} \n  2 & -1 \\\\ 1& 2\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}  \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\begin{bmatrix} \n  -1  \\\\  2\\\\  0 \\end{bmatrix} The third vector v_3 can be chosen to be a  unit vector orthogonal to both v_1 and v_2 . As the third component of both these vectors are 0 , the third vector can be taken as v_3= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} As such, {\\color{blue} \n   V = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}  & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 &1\\end{bmatrix}  } The first and the second column might be exchanged. The final SVD, is \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} =  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}  \\begin{bmatrix} \\sqrt{5} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sqrt{5} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}   \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} & 0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}  & \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 &1\\end{bmatrix} ^T",

The eigenvector equation associated with the eigenvalue \\lambda_1=1 is (A-I)\\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\\\ x_2\\end{bmatrix}=0 \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2+i \\\\ 0 & 2\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1\\\\ x_2\\end{bmatrix} = 0 This gives x_2=0 , so we might choose a unit norm eigenvector as v_1=\\begin{bmatrix} 1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} and then choose an othonormal vector as v_2=\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} . So that U_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}=I . Performing the first similarity transformation on A , we have U_1^* A U_1 = A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2+i \\\\ 0 & 3\\end{bmatrix} But if we choose v_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix} , then U_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} . In this case, if we perform simlarity transformation: \\begin{aligned}\nU_1^* A U_1 &= U_1^* \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2+i \\\\ 0 & 3\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n& = U_1^* \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2+i \\\\ 0 & 3\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n& =\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2+i \\\\ 0 & 3\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n& = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & -(2+i)\\\\ 0 & 3\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned} So that the matrix will be of the form \\begin{bmatrix}1 & x\\\\ 0 & 3\\end{bmatrix} for some complex number x .",

However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason? As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation? Thank you and Regards Akshit",

I correctly applied the logic and I admit that there is little mistake in my code but I can fix it if the output is visible . I think most of us manage the error in their code by checking with the output and modifying the code as per the output , it is just normal. But due to that type error, I got confused whether the code logic is correct or not, if it is showing the output then I can modify the code to get the correct output. Sir , if the marks will not be given 4 months will be wasted without mistake. So , please take this into consideration.",

We kind of have made this thing in our mind fix that IIT Prof are meant to be like this in online and offline degree. I do not want to just do PYQ and learn some of the methods to solve those particular type of questions and solve PYQ from youtube solutions. This is what type of mentality which I found in many students when I talked to them, even those who got S grade, when I reach them and ask some general doubts they say who cares why this is happening, just remember the method of solving it and do it. If you go on learning in this way you will not able to score. I did not joined this degree because of IIT tag, I joined this thinking I will be having time to learn extra skills, but now I find myself just scrolling for alternative videos of almost every topic on youtube whole day If professors are not being able to make us learn those topics then replace them or provide some other alternatives, because if those videos are not helpful then why are they there. Even Instructors videos can be recorded as they teach far better than Professors. At last we should care about are we learning or not properly, instead of from whom we are learning.",

If you look back through discussions, you’ll see I said almost these exact words a year ago! Back then, there were a few (most notably Karthik) who stepped in to mediate (not to justify, mind you) and shared their thoughts on how we - students - should be willing to step up ourselves in the midst of all these…not so encouraging, not very conducive or sometimes even depressing environments.

    "text": "I know difficulties make us stronger, but even after completing foundation and diploma in programming courses, I regret only one thing and that is I could have learnt more in that subject. I always get feeling after completing every course even with S or A grade that I just completed the course just for sake of marks and in rush. I really want to learn in detail and learn every basic concept which is in that syllabus. Because of that kind of teaching and even after wandering on youtube, there are many topics which I left and regret that. Now I started having regret over my decision of taking this degree as standalone degree. Its not easy for us to convince our parent for an online degree. After 12th just being enrolled in a online degree and finding yourself trapped in your own decision is the biggest guilt which I have today. Being in school, I learnt Cpp, C, Java, Python, JS, React Js and always used to study as much as possible in programming from internet. Internet searching for this course should be like learning few topics which you did not understand or learn some topic in depth. If this is the case that we have to go for almost every topic on youtube then we could have been provided the syllabus in detail and asked to learn it by ourselves. Atleast the money could have been used in purchasing some good courses. In some course if I am lucky to find some good channel on youtube then I am able to learn but if unluckily I did not find then I have to leave that topic. Most of the time it happens when end term is coming then I find one good channel, which is too late. I respect your opinion but its just how I feel as a standalone degree student.",

The screenshots are captured before and after the he edited the ledger to show us how to create it. Maybe this is the reason why so many answers you checked were incorrectly marked You guys have done wrong calculations yourself and then evaluated the answers based on those erroneous calculations.

    "text": "Subject: Request for Fair Evaluation Regarding Faulty Python Exam Question I am writing this to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding one of the Python questions in our recent exam. The issue lies not with the students, but with the incorrect way the question was provided. The syntax and structure given in the problem caused confusion and multiple errors, even when the logic was absolutely correct. In my case (and many of my classmates’), I initially attempted the question using list comprehension — which should’ve worked perfectly for such a simple task. However, due to the way the problem was structured, we kept receiving type errors. I then tried using a basic for loop with for i in strings, which also failed due to the same faulty input. After wasting more than half an hour trying every possible correction, I ended up submitting a version that I knew wasn’t logically ideal, simply because I had no other option. Now we are being told that the question had some issues and it has been corrected. The new rule is that our submitted code will be tested again, and marks will be given only if it passes now. With all due respect, this approach is unfair. The original error was not ours — it was in the question itself. We wrote the right logic but were misled by the incorrect format. What about the students who passed the course but scored low due to this error? And even more importantly, what about those who failed only because of this one 20-mark question and now have to repeat the course? Therefore, I humbly request one of the following: Either full bonus marks (20) should be given to everyone for that question, OR You review the screen recordings to see who all had attempted the logic correctly, even if their final submission was affected by the error. This is not just about marks, it’s about fairness. I hope you will take this matter seriously and consider the impact this has had on many sincere students. Sincerely,",

The function defined in the question prompt had an incorrect parameter, and due to that — along with a mismatch in the Python version/interface used during the exam — many of our correct solutions failed to pass the test cases. Several students, including myself, wrote logically correct and executable code that runs successfully in a standard Python environment (like Python 3.10+). However, because of technical limitations in the exam interface and the mistake in the question itself, we are now being awarded 0 marks for a question we solved correctly. This is disheartening, especially considering it was a 20-mark question — a significant weightage — and the issue was not on the student’s end. I kindly request the course team to consider awarding full  marks to all students who attempted this question with correct logic, irrespective of the test case outputs. This would ensure fairness and uphold the academic integrity of the evaluation. Hoping for a positive resolution.",

So, your comment should say “lengths divisible by either 3 or 5” rather than “both.” The comment “both 3 and 5” would imply you’re looking for lengths divisible by 3 and 5 at the same time (which would mean divisible by 15).

I would sincerely request you to please believe me when I say this: I clearly remember submitting the Week 3 graded assignment a day before the deadline. I even saw the result displayed earlier, which is why I was confident that everything was in order — until the final marks were published on the dashboard, which came as a complete shock. After that, I checked Discourse and saw that several other students are facing similar issues. However, in my case, the situation is even more serious since the submission itself is no longer present in the portal. I strongly suspect this could be a backend issue — perhaps a data transaction was rolled back, or the submission API failed silently. I’ve also noticed similar inconsistencies this term with programming assignments in Java and SC, though I didn’t raise them earlier since they carried less weightage (e.g., in the image below, you’ll notice I submitted PGAs for most weeks — why would I skip just one?). But this Week 3 graded assignment holds significant weight, and the impact is much greater. I kindly request the team to please investigate this matter in detail, verify server logs if needed, and escalate it to the concerned authorities if necessary.

    "text": "Okay, you may disagree with the title but have a look at this. Problem Statement: Given a positive integer n, you are allowed to perform the following operations on n: Divide by 2 . Divide by 3 . Subtract 1 . Your goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce n to 1. The code below isn’t mine. I couldn’t stop obsessing over this problem and came close to solving it but couldn’t. So, I ended up asking ChatGPT for help, and here we are. The idea of using a simple BFS with queue to search the solution space (for this particular problem) totally blew my mind. I never thought of it that way! I was stuck on dynamic programming (specifically memoization) the whole time and even tried a recursive approach, but the BFS solution never crossed my mind. Maybe whenever we use the memoization technique, thinking in terms of BFS might come in handy. Programming noob so forgive me if it’s too basic for you.. haha! Enjoy the solution. from collections import deque\n\ndef min_steps_to_one(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0  # No steps needed if already at 1\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([(n, 0)])  # (current number, steps)\n    visited = set([n])  # To track visited numbers\n    \n    while queue:\n        current, steps = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Try the three possible operations\n        for next_num in [current - 1, current // 2 if current % 2 == 0 else None, current // 3 if current % 3 == 0 else None]:\n            if next_num is not None and next_num not in visited:\n                if next_num == 1:\n                    return steps + 1\n                visited.add(next_num)\n                queue.append((next_num, steps + 1))\n    \n    return -1  # This should never happen if n >= 1\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 10\nprint(min_steps_to_one(n))  # Output: 3 Initial Setup: Queue : Start with 101010 and 0 steps. Queue = [(10, 0)] Visited Set : Track visited numbers. Visited = {10} Example Walkthrough: Let’s take an example with n=10. We will use BFS to find the minimum steps to reach 1. Initial Setup: Queue : Start with 10 and 0 steps. Queue = [(10, 0)] Visited Set : Track visited numbers. Visited = {10} Step 1: Process 10 Dequeue 10 from the queue (current number: 10, steps: 0). Possible next numbers: Subtract 1: 10−1=9 (enqueue 9). Divide by 2: 10÷2=5 (enqueue 5). Divide by 3: Not possible since 10 is not divisible by 3. Enqueue the valid results: Queue = [(9, 1), (5, 1)] Visited = {10, 9, 5} Step 2: Process 9 Dequeue 9 from the queue (current number: 9, steps: 1). Possible next numbers: Subtract 1: 9−1=8 (enqueue 8). Divide by 2: Not possible since 9 is not divisible by 2. Divide by 3: 9÷3=33 (enqueue 3). Enqueue the valid results: Queue = [(5, 1), (8, 2), (3, 2)] Visited = {10, 9, 5, 8, 3} Step 3: Process 5 Dequeue 5 from the queue (current number: 5, steps: 1). Possible next numbers: Subtract 1: 5−1=4 (enqueue 4). Divide by 2: Not possible since 5 is not divisible by 2. Divide by 3: Not possible since 5 is not divisible by 3. Enqueue the valid results: Queue = [(8, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)] Visited = {10, 9, 5, 8, 3, 4} Step 4: Process 8 Dequeue 8 from the queue (current number: 8, steps: 2). Possible next numbers: Subtract 1: 8−1=7 (enqueue 7). Divide by 2: 8÷2=4 (but 4 is already visited, so don’t enqueue). Divide by 3: Not possible since 8 is not divisible by 3. Enqueue the valid result: Queue = [(3, 2), (4, 2), (7, 3)] Visited = {10, 9, 5, 8, 3, 4, 7} Step 5: Process 3 Dequeue 3 from the queue (current number: 3, steps: 2). Possible next numbers: Subtract 1: 3−1=2 (enqueue 2). Divide by 2: Not possible since 3 is not divisible by 2. Divide by 3: 3÷3=1 (we reach 1!). We have reached 1 , and the number of steps taken is 3 .",

I am writing to bring to your attention a discrepancy I’ve noticed in my DBMS OPPE marks for the morning session (9:30 AM – 11:00 AM) held on 30th March 2025. Initially, my result reflected a score of 60%, but today, upon checking the portal, I noticed that it has been updated to 52%. Specifically, I observed that Question 1, for which I had originally received 100/100, is now marked as 0/100. I understand that the expected output for Question 1 involved an OR query, but during the OPPE, every time I submitted the OR query, the system consistently returned 0/100. After multiple failed attempts, I used an AND query, which surprisingly gave me a full score. I did raise this concern with the proctor at the time, but unfortunately, I did not receive any response or assistance. Given the situation and the fact that the discrepancy form is now closed, I am unable to raise this through the regular channel. I kindly request you to please look into this issue as my marks depend on it. Thanks and Regards DBMS marks 1753×853 56.9 KB @PiyushW",

Few instructors and TAs made students life easy with such sessions and notes. You are one of them!!. Maths2,Pyhton,MLF and now MLT are made easy because of your live sessions and notes. Many of us posted this before.(for instance, one can refer the comments section of live sessions YT). This is not intended for flattery. I am a big fan of your notes and sessions. From the thumbnail in YT to the way you explain are examples of your perfection to the minute details. One request to you: The following session notes are not available in your notes folders. Kindly share them if you saved them somewhere. It’s a revision session on Regression problems,streamed live on Mar 28, 2023. As usual, the underlying concepts are neatly explained with 9 questions. Question on Gradient descent is a real eye opener (at least for me). It would be helpful if you can share them here. YouTube Regression: Practice Problems Once again thanking you for your support!",

But Karthik Sir proved it wrong in his open sessions. His sessions are perfect complement to Arun sir Lectures. For example, Week 3 Lloyds algorithm explained in lectures in a nice way. A perfect complement to it is the Karthi sir session with a toy data set example. From the slides used in sessions, Mathcha to explain the concepts with black fonts, Karthik sir never shown his handwriting. Whereas Arun Sir explained the concepts with his beautiful hand writing and colored texts. You can notice that Karthik sir revision sessions is different to the week-wise open sessions. I preferred T3 2023 sessions than T2 2024, because of the audience, to name a few, Ajr Vasu, Ravi, Uma, Sarvesh. I have become fan of not only Karthik Sir, but also of these guys. I am grateful to Karthik sir for his open sessions and notes. He made Maths2, Python and MLT easy and interesting.",

When we asked if the students would be let to stay there between the forenoon and afternoon session (as the centre is pretty far away from my residence and we were let to stay back in other centres), the person over there was extremely rude in answering the question. They were extremely unprofessional. I have always faced issues with this centre and none of my experiences with this centre were pleasant. Hence, I kindly request you to please give me other centres in Chennai avadi from the next time. For all the quizzes and tests I’ve attended, the centres were marked as chennai avadi but ends up being in Chennai south, which is extremely long from my residence. Thanking you.",

There have been cases of people getting centers as far as Mahabalipuram. I don’t think much can be done for it, as the process is normally randomized.

Eg: time diff between : 5:30 and 6:45 convert 5:30 to minutes - 5x60+30=330 mins convert 6:45 to minutes - 6x60+45= 405 mins abs diff = 75 mins now convert to hrs: 75 mins//60 = 1 Hr convert to mins : 75%60= 15 mins so the diff is 1:15 mins.. i hope this helps..",

Use SUBSTITUTE() Answer : C — The VALUE function converts text that appears as numbers into actual numeric values. This is useful when data is imported with formatting issues. Module: Data Analysis Q11: Outlier Detection You are analyzing a dataset of employee salaries. Which visualization is best for quickly identifying outliers? A. Line chart B. Box plot C. Histogram D. Pie chart Answer : B — A box plot clearly shows the spread of data and highlights outliers as individual points beyond the whiskers. Module: Large Language Models Q12: Prompt Engineering Strategy To get consistent, structured responses from a language model when extracting key information, which approach is most effective? A. Ask the model to “summarize” the text B. Use open-ended questions C. Use system messages and JSON schema formatting D. Provide only one-word inputs Answer : C — System messages and structured output formats like JSON schemas guide the model to generate reliable and consistent structured responses. Module: Geospatial and Network Analysis Q13: Network Centrality In a social network graph of coworkers, which metric best identifies the person who connects the most groups together? A. Degree centrality B. Closeness centrality C. Betweenness centrality D. Eigenvector centrality Answer : C — Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on shortest paths between other nodes, highlighting connectors or “bridges” in the network. Module: Data Visualization Q14: Choosing the Right Chart You want to show how the composition of a marketing budget changes across three years. Which visualization is most appropriate? A. Pie charts for each year B. Scatter plots C. Stacked bar chart D. Line chart Answer : C — A stacked bar chart shows parts of a whole across different categories and time periods, making it easier to compare budget composition over years.",

Unfortunately, due to poor financial conditions, I couldn’t take admission. I am a good student, but the current situation is such that I’m helpless and unable to do anything. So please guide me — is there any way I can appear only for the end-term exam in the next term? Because I can’t even register for the diploma level since I haven’t completed the foundation.

    "text": "To find the power of the test against the alternative H_A: p \\neq 0.5 , we first need to understand the rejection region defined by the test. The test rejects H_0 if |X - 300| > 50 , which translates to: X < 250 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad X > 350 Given that X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(100, p) , we can standardize X to use the normal approximation for large n : Z = \\frac{X - np}{\\sqrt{np(1-p)}} For our case, n = 100 and np = 100p . Thus, the mean and variance of X are: \\mu = 100p, \\quad \\sigma^2 = 100p(1-p) Now, we need to find the power of the test, which is the probability of rejecting H_0 when H_A is true. This can be expressed as: P(X < 250 \\text{ or } X > 350 \\mid p) Using the normal approximation, we can calculate: For X < 250 : P(X < 250) = P\\left(Z < \\frac{250 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) For X > 350 : P(X > 350) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{350 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) = 1 - P\\left(Z < \\frac{350 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) Now, we can combine these probabilities: P(X < 250 \\text{ or } X > 350) = P(X < 250) + P(X > 350) Substituting the expressions we derived: = P\\left(Z < \\frac{250 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) + \\left(1 - P\\left(Z < \\frac{350 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right)\\right) This simplifies to: = P\\left(Z < \\frac{250 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) + 1 - P\\left(Z < \\frac{350 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) Using the cumulative distribution function F_Z : = F_Z\\left(\\frac{250 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) + 1 - F_Z\\left(\\frac{350 - 100p}{\\sqrt{100p(1-p)}}\\right) Now, we can express this in terms of the standard normal variable Z : = F_Z\\left(\\frac{250 - 100p}{10\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right) + 1 - F_Z\\left(\\frac{350 - 100p}{10\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right) Finally, we can rewrite the power of the test as: = 1 + F_Z\\left(\\frac{250 - 100p}{10\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right) - F_Z\\left(\\frac{350 - 100p}{10\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right) Thus, the power of the test against the alternative \\text{Binomial}(100, p) is: \\boxed{1 + F_Z\\left(\\frac{25 - 10p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right) - F_Z\\left(\\frac{35 - 10p}{\\sqrt{p(1-p)}}\\right)} Hope it helps you.",

Here u r computing at most one hop in the first code, see the line: tempMat = AM copies the direct matrix from any i to j now,  this condition: if(AM[i][k] == 1 and AM [k][j]==1) tells u about the one hop: why bcz, u can see that u r going from i->k->j, so there is only one stop “k” b/w i and j, hence, this tells u about the one hop route, now the line, tempMat[i][j] = 1 tells u that there exists a direct edge b/w i and j so this is the direct route from i to j. So, now if we look into the first question, newMatrix= updateMatrix(M) a = newMatrix [1] [3] b = newMatrix [4] [5], they are asking for atmost 1 hop, but u see there is no way u r able to teach from 1->3 in either o or 1 hop, so it returns 0, but from 4->5 there exists a 0 hop route, that is, a direct edge, so b=1. Now, in the second question: newMatrix1= updateMatrix(M) newMatrix2 = updateMatrix (newMatrix1) a =newMatrix2 [1] [3] b = newMatrix2 [4] [5], if u look a bit carefully then u will fins that the one hop matrix is being copied again in the 2nd line, so it suggests atmost 2 hop, now, a=0 and b=1 , and regarding your first answer u r getting is correct, no worries!! This was all from my side. All the best!!",

T1 -------> T3 --------> T2 No cycle so it is conflict serializable Now, for the locks part, we can see that the once the shrinking phase starts none of the transactions go back to growing phase, so that means it is two phase lockable. Here if you see just above the shrinking phase of T3, we have locked A - this is because we need to release the lock on B for T2. So if we release B without locking A, then it will violate Two phase locking. So we lock A first and then release B. About strict two phase locking, from what I understand, the locks should be held until the transaction commits. Here that’s not the case. The locks of T2 and T3 are released before commit. So I’m not sure why that option is marked right. Hope this helps!",

So eigen vectors of \\mathbf{XX}^T and \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X} will not be same Now coming to the question, the given kernel matrix is X^TX which is basically using the linear kernel so there will be no mapping to higher dimension. But for finding the principal direction we use eigen vectors of this kernel matrix to find eigen vectors of covariance matrix. Specifically: If v is an eigenvector of X^TX then Xv is an eigenvector of XX^T . So, the directions (in original space) will be the same.",

Initially, my exam dashboard did not open, showing that someone else was already giving the exam and it was redirecting me to the dashboard this message was showing on my screen. I reported this to Proctor 430 at approx 1:15, proctor said me that he sent the message to the higher authoritites and after nearly an hour, Gayatri resolved the issue. Due to this delay, I only had one hour to complete the two-hour exam, and it ended automatically without any time extension and I did not complete the exam on Time. Proctor 430 acknowledged the issue, assured me that it would be resolved, and advised me to write this email to you. I haven’t noted about the mental pressure I felt on that time I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter, either by retake the exam or providing a fair solution. Thank you for your understanding. I look forward to your response. I sent this mail to support team, after it I got this reply from there end : Dear Student, If you encounter video feed or technical issues in Google Meet, the proctor may create an instant meeting or ask you to join via a laptop. If you have faced such issues during the exam, please inform the proctor. They will assist you, or our team will step in to provide support. Once you have completed your exam, kindly wait for the results. If you have attended the exam, kindly wait for your OPPE exam results to be released. Based on your course grade, you may repeat the course and register for it during the next term’s course registration period. I think they haven’t read the message and just reply without solving out the problem",

After the executive summary, we have the analysis section. If I directly start start some other analysis, the person who reads this report will not be able to get the context. To establish the context, I feel some of the content from the midterm section is needed in the final too. I also saw, in one of the posts earlier, that around 15 to 20 percent of the final report can have mid-term report’s content My doubt : Can I have a sub-section under “Detailed Explanation of Analysis Process/Method”  which will summarize the key analysis and findings from mid-term report? My analysis in the final section depends on the findings of the mid-term section. While I summarize my midterm findings, I will need just one graph from my mid-term report. Since the final report must have five to eight graphs, will this graph taken from mid-term be considered one among the five to eight graphs? I have one more doubt regarding the difference between the analysis section and results & findings section of the final report. Suppose I do correlation analysis, this will include a few components Component In which section it should be Data used for correlation Analysis section Formula used Analysis section Correlation coefficient Analysis section Implication of the correlation coefficient Results and Findings Section Is my understanding correct?

If I can have 15 to 20 percent of my mid-term report in the final report, does it mean I can have just one graph from mid-term. It will help me to set the context in my final report. If yes, will it be considered among the five to eight graphs which is required for final. Or, should I give five to eight graphs excluding this? image 972×334 26.5 KB This post says that I can have graph. My doubt is about whether it is counted in one among the five to eight graphs. Here, it also says it should explain above and beyond what midterm has. In my particular case, I am not using this graph to gain more insights. But as a reason to why the new analysis is necessary. Is this also fine? Thank You B.R. Giri Subrahmanya",

    "text": "Hi, If the first array has m elements and second array has n elements, max comparisons = m+n-1. Here it is mentioned that the merge will combine arrays pairwise. To do it optimally, first sort the arrays based on their size, so that we can reduce the number of comparisons. So  - 5,10,12,15,16. Now take the first two arrays - max comparisons = 5 + 10 -1 = 14. when we combine the first two arrays - total elements = 15. Now again pick the two arrays which have smaller number of elements -that will be the combined array with 15 elements and the array with 12 elements. Total comparisons = 12 + 15 - 1 = 26. Total elements in the combined array = 27. Now our array list looks like = 27, 15,16. Now pick 15 and 16 to combine. Tot comparisons = 15 + 16 - 1 = 30.Total elems = 31. Now finally combine 31 and 27. Total comparisons = 31 + 27 -1  = 57 and total elements = 58. Sum of comparisons = 14 + 26 + 30 + 57 = 127. Hope this helps!",

You can call their toll-free numbers: 1800 103 0025 1800 419 0025 Alternatively, you can email your query to efilingwebmanager@incometax.gov.in. Provide the acknowledgment number received via SMS and explain that the application was submitted in error. They will guide you on the next steps. Use the NSDL Portal for PAN Cancellation If the new e-PAN has already been issued, you can surrender it by following these steps: Visit the official NSDL portal. Select “Services” > “PAN” > “Changes or Correction in existing PAN data.” Choose “Changes or Correction in existing PAN Data/ Reprint of PAN Card (No changes in existing PAN Data)” under “Application Type.” Fill out the form, mentioning the PAN you wish to surrender, and submit it. Submit a Letter to Your Local Assessing Officer If online cancellation is not possible, draft a letter to your local Income Tax Assessing Officer requesting cancellation of the duplicate PAN. Include: Details of both PAN cards (existing and newly applied). A copy of both PAN cards (if available). A declaration stating that your mother wishes to retain her original PAN issued in 2013. Monitor Status You can check the status of your cancellation request by visiting the NSDL or Income Tax Department website. Use your acknowledgment number to track progress. Important Notes Holding multiple PAN cards is a violation under Section 139A of the Income Tax Act and may attract a penalty of ₹10,000 under Section 272B. Ensure this issue is resolved promptly. If you face any challenges, you can also visit your nearest NSDL collection center or contact them at +91-20-27218080 for further assistance. By following these steps, you should be able to cancel the new e-PAN application successfully.",

The reason seems to be that this was because the syntax used is valid only starting Python 3.9. Since the compiler in the exam was on an earlier version (presumably, 3.7), it resulted in an error. Many students who faced this error were unable to decipher what it meant and fix it, as it is something we haven’t encountered earlier. Hence, they lost 20 marks despite having written the correct solution code for the problem. I request the staff to kindly help out by providing a solution to those affected. Thank you!",

Until yesterday, my marks were showing as 36 , but today it has unexpectedly changed to 28 . This sudden drop is extremely concerning, especially since marks below 35 are considered a fail in the Oppé. What adds to the confusion is that no REOPPE has been scheduled for me, nor have I received any communication regarding a change in marks. I am deeply worried about the impact this could have on my academic progress and request your immediate attention to this matter. Kindly verify the issue at the earliest and let me know if this is due to an error or if further action is required from my end. I would be grateful for your prompt response.

However, I have not progressed much at the diploma level since then due to personal reasons, such as not being able to find the balance between work and coursework, lack of discipline and so on. I have so far completed MAD-I(Theory n Project), MAD-II(Theory), DBMS, TDS, BDM, MLF, and PDSA. I still need to complete MLT, SC, MLP(Theory n Project), Java, BA, MAD-II(Project), and BDM(Project). I now worry that I might run out of time to finish these courses. Can someone please help me with the following questions: How many more terms do I have to finish my remaining diploma courses? Any suggestions on in which order I should go with taking the courses to finish them at the earliest? Any other general advice to balance professional and academic aspects going forward? Thank you.",

    "text": "22f2000784: How many more terms do I have to finish my remaining diploma courses? If you started your diploma in the Jan 23 term, then you have already used 7 terms and have 5 more terms to finish both the diplomas. But, if you started you diploma in the May 23 term, then you have only used 6 terms and have 6 more terms to finish both the diplomas. 22f2000784: Any suggestions on in which order I should go with taking the courses to finish them at the earliest? You can finish the remaining courses in 2 terms easily. MLT is a prerequisite for MLP, so here is what I think you should take: Term 1 (May 25 term): MLT, JAVA, SC, and one project (I would recommend the BDM project with secondary route) Term 2 (Sep 25 term): MLP (Th & Pr), BA, and one remaining project. Term 1 could be a little hectic because MLT in itself requires time, and SC demands practice to clear the oppe. Java is easy in terms of theory and oppe both; if you practice pyq’s, you will score well in quizzes and end term, and If you practice the live coding questions on the portal, you will score well in oppe. The reason I have kept both the OPPE courses in term 1 is if you by chance fail in OPPE, you still have one more term to go, and you can do OPPE only in the next term as disaster management. Now, I recommend taking the BDM project in term 1 because the chances of you getting your report rejected are quite high, and the team is not at all helpful they can reject your report for the stupidest reason. So if you couldn’t complete it in the first term, you will still have a backup term in your hand. And I recommend the secondary route because you have one less submission in it, so one less report to worry about getting rejected. Now, MLP also has OPPE, but you can’t take it before completing MLT. But if you want to take it nice and easy and do it in three terms, then here is what I would recommend: Term 1 (May 25 term): MLT, BA, BDM Project Term 2 (Sep 25 term): JAVA, SC, MAD-II Project Term 3 (Jan 26 term): MLP (Th & Pr) BA is not that tough, so you can also have it in term 3 instead of term 1 if you want. 22f2000784: Any other general advice to balance professional and academic aspects going forward? Well, I cannot quite comment on this as I am a standalone student just pursuing this degree as of now. But there are many people who are currently working in the industry and pursuing this degree alongside, so I think they might be better ones to answer this. I hope this helps.",

In svm we say that the margin is formed using the closest datapoint to the linear classifier but to find the w eventually the linear classifier we do the dual problem and we get alphai xi yi and we say whose alpha i i> 0 it is  the support vector. so the support vectors are the ones whose distance is closest . but my doubt is y we take all vectors that lie on the line if they all lie on the same hyperplane every one will have the same distance from the line so taking any one support vector it will give us the margin right y take all if they are all on same hyperplane i dont understand this aphai thing y it differs if they are all one same hyperplane. pls clarify thank you @Karthik_POD @mayurg @PulkitMangal @23f1001171",

With this and also some remarks made by the instructors during the explanation sessions in mind, would it be prudent to prepare using previous years’ question papers (ET, quizzes) & TA sessions only? OR Is the Team expecting the students to expand more, as there would be questions that won’t be just non-numerical repeats (just the numbers would be changed, concepts would be the same), but can be picked from the general subject matter? The preparation using this course material alone has certainly been very rewarding, to say the least. Will the question paper also reward those who go the extra mile? I mean questions from the syllabus but have never been asked before . Could the team shed some light on this matter? Thanks and best regards Many greetings.",

Well, The ones who get S are these only, they have been consistent through out and they know each and every concept. 21f2001527: I mean questions from the syllabus but have never been asked before .

Long way: (rigorous - always works) Try re-writing the constraint like this : x = \\sqrt{16- 4 y^2} Then you can maximize f= y\\sqrt{16- 4 y^2} you should get y=\\sqrt{2} and x=\\sqrt{8} Short method ( only for this particular equations): Intuitively, I would look at the constrain as sum of two squares equal to a constant. Then I know that the product xy is maximum when they are equal- (product two numbers is maximum when they are equal). So, if I take the individual terms in the constrain to be equal then x^2/8 = y^2/2 =1 , giving me the answer. image 1483×763 46.1 KB",

Now, when we do a natural join between R and S, here the common col is Y.  In S, Y is not the key so it can have duplicate values also. i.e at the max S can have 250 unique values of Y (which will match with the 250 unique values in R) plus 50 values of Y which can be a repetition of the already used values (these will also match with some Y in R). So at the max we can have 300 tuples in the join of R and S. Hope this helps!",

    "text": "Hi, In Timestamp protocol, whenever a transaction issues a RW request on a data item, we check if that data item has been modified by a younger transaction previously. If that is the case then we rollback the current transaction. For eg. if we have 2 transactions T1 and T2 where T1 is older and T2 is younger and let’s say T2 modified a data item A. Now, at a later point, if T1 issues a read or write request on that data item A,  we first check the Write timestamp of A. Here, the write timestamp of A will be higher than the timestamp of T1. (Read/write timestamp is the timestamp of the transaction that has modified the item recently).   Since TS(T2) > TS(T1) and T2 modified A recently, WTS(A) will be greater than TS(T1). In that case, the transaction T1 will be rolled back. So the basic idea is that if a data item is modified by a younger transaction, then an older transaction should not be allowed to read/write on it at a later point. Here in this question we have to check for such conflicts and choose the timestamps which will allow the schedule to proceed. For eg. there is a RW conflict between R4(A) and W2(A). For W2(A) to continue, the read timestamp of A should should be less than TS(T2) i.e A should have been modified by transaction older than T2. i.e. T2 should be the younger transaction and T4 should be the older transaction. So timestamp of T2 > timestamp of T4. Now, form the options, we have a and c which satisfies this. Similarly look for other transactions and conflicts also and keep eliminating the options. This is just my understanding of the concept. For better clarity and a structured approach to solve this question, let’s check with @Manidipa2001 maa’m Ma’am could you please also  check if my understanding of timestamp protocol is right?",

This usually happens in loops, lambda functions etc. Hence, powers_of_3 = [81, 81, 81, 81] So all the as tests fails, marking third option as correct.

If the probability of completing the task individually is 1/2,1/4, and, 1/8 respectively, then find the probability that the task is completed. Using the Total Probability Theorem: We are given that one of the three students — Riddhi, Shivansh, or Prateek — is chosen at random to complete the task. Their individual probabilities of successfully completing the task are: Riddhi: 1/2 Shivansh: 1/4 Prateek: 1/8 Since the student is selected at random, each has a probability of 1/3​ of being chosen. Using the Total Probability Theorem , the overall probability that the task is completed is: Now calculate each term: P(task completed by riddhi) = (1/3).(1/2)=1/6 P(task completed by shivansh) = (1/3).(1/4)=1/12 P(task completed by prateek) = (1/3).(1/8)=1/24 Adding them: (1/6)+(1/12)+(1/24)= 7⁄24 . Final Answer: 7/24 So, the probability that the task is completed is 7⁄24 . Why this approach is wrong? @Prashant2",

Hence you cannot apply this theorem. You can solve this by P(A \\cup B\\cup C)=P(A)+P(B)+P(C)-P(A\\cap B)-P(B\\cap C)-P(A\\cap C)+P(A\\cap B\\cap C) So, As the events are independent meaning P(X\\cap Y) = P(X)\\cdot P(Y) \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{2\\cdot 4} - \\frac{1}{4 \\cdot 8} - \\frac{1}{8 \\cdot 2} + \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{7}{8} - \\frac{7}{32}+\\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{56-14+1}{64} = \\frac{43}{64} Hope this helps, Thank you.",

However, in the grades section, I noticed that Question 2 is labeled as “Evaluation Pending” , and I have received a score of 0 for it. Due to this, my overall percentage is being calculated as approximately 62% , but if the score for Question 2 is included as it should be (since it passed all test cases), my percentage would be around 75%.",

    "text": "I love this comment by Karanjeet Kaur here : India’s startup innovation crisis: Vegan ice cream vs deep tech The first frontier is the family, which discourages any risk-taking, followed closely by India’s education system, designed to suffocate any creative impulse. From the earliest years, schools reward memorisation over meaning. In these cognitive prisons, divergent thinking is actively punished. Students learn quickly that questioning the teacher or exploring tangential ideas leads to lower marks. All this while, the muscle of creative thinking atrophies. An art workshop with young children who reproduced the same mountain-sun-river picture plastered across the walls of every Indian institution. When children are taught that their worth is measured by their ability to reproduce textbook knowledge and even fun is standardised, why are we surprised when they grow into adults who struggle to colour outside the lines? By the time these students reach adulthood, they’ve internalised a profound risk aversion. We have engineering graduates with no sense of history and business students who can only parrot case studies. These are not failures of individual imagination but predictable outcomes of our educational methodology. This is how we end up with a “demographic dividend” that is hardly employable , and a Global Innovation Index rank of 39.",

Imo invest a little bit more on ram and go with 16gb ram if your laptop allows, save on ssd part and spend on ram. As you’re not into gaming you can consider ditching windows and shift to linux. 250gb ssd will be more than sufficient for running linux and do coding. As far as mic is concerned you can get a decent external mic for 600-700 which will go a long way.",

I could also write the quadratic form of f as: \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\\\1 & 1\\end{bmatrix} Which has eigenvalues 2 and 0 . This is also positive semidefinite. Am I misunderstanding something? Or did you mean the matrix had to be positive definite for the function to be strictly convex, which is what I thought? Thanks.",

    "text": "Hello everyone, I’m currently in my foundation level and doing the last two subjects of this stage in this term. Unfortunately, due to some serious family issues, I haven’t been able to study for the past two months. As a result, I performed poorly in Quiz 2, and things have only gotten worse since then. After Quiz 2, I was unable to even watch the lecture videos. To be honest, from Week 5 to Week 12 , I haven’t been able to keep up at all in either of the two subjects — Maths-2 and Stats-2 . I feel completely blank in both. Given my current situation, I strongly feel that attempting the ET exam this term would likely result in failure. I’m now considering re-attempting both subjects in the next term , as I want to learn them properly and maintain the quality of my academic performance.

    "text": "@PiyushW @23f2005657 @Manidipa2001 Dear Sir/Ma’am, I am Yashasvita Khandelwal, currently enrolled in the diploma level of the IITM BS Degree Program. Today, I attempted the Re-OPPE for DBMS. I have some queries and issues that I kindly ask you to address. If there are network issues on your side that prevent you from seeing students’ videos during the exam, why is it acceptable to disturb students while they are trying to complete their exams? If the issue were with the students’ connections, their videos in the portal would also not be visible, and they would not be able to answer questions on the portal. While I was taking the exam today, I did not experience any network issues on my end. Despite this, the proctor repeatedly asked me to rejoin the meeting and suggested that I switch to my laptop. However, we all know that if the exam portal is using the camera, another tab cannot access it simultaneously. The proctor also suggested joining in incognito mode and provided me with another meeting link. When I tried to access it, the other proctor informed me that I couldn’t join the instant meeting. After some discussion with the team, I was eventually allowed to join. Considering the exam duration was only 1.5 hours, I have to ask: how much time was wasted due to all these issues? It is clear that if I had no network problems on my side, the difficulties were likely due to your end. As a result, I wasted approximately 30 to 45 minutes and was unable to complete my exam, despite knowing all the answers. This same situation occurred during OPPE-1, and it seems nothing has changed. I would like to know who is responsible for this situation and the loss of marks I have faced. I have studied diligently, yet due to network issues beyond my control, I was unable to finish my exam. Additionally, if the exam portal is recording my video and I have shared my screen while continuously typing, it is evident that cheating would be highly difficult. I understand some students may cheat, but it is unfair to penalize everyone for the actions of a few. I was left with only 30 minutes to complete my exam. Thank you for addressing my concerns. Sincerely, Yashasvita Khandelwal",

    "text": "Analogy: Climbing a Mountain Think of NP as a giant mountain of problems. Most are easy foothills — easy to climb (P) Some are trickier — we can check if you reached the top, but climbing is hard (NP) NP-complete problems are like the peak of the mountain: Reach the peak, and you now know the way to climb all others. They’re in NP (you can check if you’re at the peak), But they’re as hard as it gets (hard as all paths in NP). P – The Base Camp Trails These are easy paths at the base of the mountain. You can climb them quickly. No guide needed. Straightforward. Can solve & check quickly. NP – The Hidden Trails The paths are hard to climb, you may have to try many options. But if someone gives you a photo from the top, you can quickly check if it’s legit. Can check quickly,  not necessarily solve quickly. NP-complete – The Peak The toughest verified trails in NP. Climb any one of them efficiently, and suddenly every path in NP becomes easy — you’ve figured out the mountain! In NP As hard as all NP problems (you can reduce everything in NP to this) NP-hard – The Other Mountains These are mountains even taller, or maybe weird ones without a peak (not decision problems). Harder or at least as hard as the NP-complete peak. BUT:Not necessarily in NP — so we may not even be able to verify solutions easily. Examples: Halting Problem, optimization versions of NP-complete problems.",

I believe the institute corrects them after reviewing, but sometimes fails to update all sources consistently. That said, they clearly have the skill to craft some thought-provoking questions. Enjoy solving them and don’t let occasional slip-ups bother you—just focus on learning and enjoying the journey. If you think IITM is the final word and nothing lies beyond, it’ll only wear you down.

Tangent plane must touch the given point. On another topic Mistakes can happen in any institute once in a while. What truly matters is that you understand the logic behind the splits and know how to compute the cost of the underlying operations. That understanding stays with you, regardless of any certificate an institute offers. I’ve noticed a few errors in some published PYQs and GA questions too. I believe the institute corrects them after reviewing, but sometimes fails to update all sources consistently. That said, they clearly have the skill to craft some thought-provoking questions. Enjoy solving them and don’t let occasional slip-ups bother you—just focus on learning and enjoying the journey. If you think IITM is the final word and nothing lies beyond, it’ll only wear you down. There’s so much more out there. Keep your curiosity alive.",

I request you to look into this issue and another issue i have posted previously regarding providing another sheet which uses dept id instead of dept name . i knwo all the methods , but just becuase i used dept id instead  of dept name during the ROE ( where everything was not alright) i lose all the marks, that doest seem fair to me. please be kind enough to go thorugh my issues . thank you sir",

The apparent uncertainty demonstrated by the instructional team regarding the course’s structure and objectives is particularly concerning. Based on current trajectories, it is reasonable to anticipate further deterioration in the upcoming term, potentially including the addition of an initial assessment (Quiz 1). Furthermore, it appears that supplementary revision sessions will once again not be offered to students.

    "text": "Hi, the decomposition being lossless and being dependency preserving are mutually exclusive, decomposition being lossless or lossy will not dictate whether it is dependency preserving or not. For option c, the functional dependencies that are applicable on relation R1(A,B,D,E) are \\{B > D, D > E, D > B, E > BD\\} so the candidate keys will be AB , AD and AE , so the prime attributes are A,B,D,E so now if we look at the functional dependency set for R1, there are no partial dependencies so the relation R1 is in 2NF. For option d, the functional dependencies that are applicable on relation R2(B, C, D, F) are \\{B > D, D > B, F > BD, D > F, B > F\\} , so the candidate key will be FC , BC and BD so the prime attributes are B,C,D,F and for a relation to be in 3NF, either the left hand side of a functional dependency has to be a super key or right hand side has to be a prime attribute, so if you look at the FD set applicable to R2, you can see that R2 is in 3NF.",

    "text": "I faced a few issues during the DBMS OPPE and with the final assignment grading that I would like to seek clarification on: OPPE Python‑PostgreSQL Question: While attempting the Python‑PostgreSQL question, I imported all the required libraries and followed the correct syntax. However, during compilation, the query was marked as “invalid syntax,” even though the compiler suggested the keyword while typing. I successfully passed 100/100 test cases in the SQL question just before this, so I’m concerned that this might affect my performance. While it’s possible I made an unintentional mistake, I would be grateful if the logs for my attempt could be reviewed to confirm the issue. Laptop Restriction During OPPE: Due to serious performance issues with my older laptop, I used a newer device to take the exam. However, the exam link didn’t allow access and showed that only the previously registered laptop could be used. Since the exam is already screen- and video-recorded, I was unsure why this restriction applies. I seek clarification on what should be done in cases where the original device becomes too slow or non-functional. Final Graded Assignment Average: I noticed that my final average for the graded assignments is showing as 60%, whereas I received 85% in one assignment which was actually my lowest among all 10. This seems inconsistent, and I kindly request a recheck of the average calculation. I double-checked my Python‑PostgreSQL code and ensured correct syntax and library usage. I’ve also reviewed the assignment scores and tried comparing them to the final average. Despite this, the issues remain unclear to me, which is why I am posting here for clarification and help from the support team. 1000200099 1080×2340 245 KB",

Problem Statement: Retrieve product_name and quantity for products where: product_name either starts with ‘J’ OR ends with ‘s’. My Initial Query (as per question requirement): sql SELECT product_name, quantity\nFROM product\nWHERE product_name LIKE 'J%' OR product_name LIKE '%s'; → Result: No test cases passed. Modified Query (Just for Checking): sql SELECT product_name, quantity\nFROM product\nWHERE product_name LIKE 'J%' AND product_name LIKE '%s'; → Result: All test cases passed. Observation: As per the question, it should be OR logic. But only AND logic passed all test cases. This indicates that there was a mismatch between the question description and test case validation. Request: Kindly consider awarding bonus marks for this question, as it was a technical issue from the question side, not a student mistake. Thank you for your understanding and support.
